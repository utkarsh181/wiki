#+TITLE: Graphs(Data Structure)

* INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS

Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.

Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications:
Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths
in a city or telephone network or circuit network.

Graph is defined as: G=(V,E), on set of vertices V, and contains a set of edges E.

* TYPES OF GRAPH

+ DIRECTED GRAPH - If edge have direction then graph is called directed graph.
  Self Loop : In a directed graph if there is a edge connecting itself
       	      then it is called self loop.
  Parallel Edges : Pair of edges between same vertices are called paralled edges.
  Indegree : Number of edges coming in to a vertex is called indegree of that vertex.
  Outdegree : Number of edges coming out from a vertex is called outdegree of that vertex.

+ SIMPLE GRAPH - Graph without self loop and parallel edges is called a simple graph.

+ NON DIRECTED GRAPH - Graph without directed edges are called non directed graph.
  Non directed graph has no indegree and outdegree , but number of edges
  connecting a vertex is called degree.

+ NON CONNECTED GRAPH -  A graph in which there does not exist any path
 between at least one pair of vertices is called as a disconnected graph.

+ CONNECTED GRAPHS -  A graph in which there exixts at least one path
  between every pair of vertices are called connected graph
  Articulation Points : Those vertices whose removal will split graph
  into two diffrent components are called articulation points.
  For ex : vertex D and F and articulation points.

+ STRONGLY CONNECTED GRAPHS -  A graph in which from every vertex we
  can reach all other vertex in called strongly connected graphs.
  Here vertex 0 , 1 , 2 forms a strongly connected graph but vertex
  3 act as articulation point.

  Path : It is set of vertices between a pair of vertex.

+ DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH - A graph not containing any cycle in it is
  called as an acyclic graph.
  Topological Ordering: If in a directed graph we can arrange vertex
  such that edges only follow only one direction and they can be arranged
  horizontally

* TYPES OF TRAVERSAL IN GRAPHS

** BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search

It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph and explores
all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the
nodes at the next depth level.

** DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search

DFS is like level order traversal in trees, where level are referred as depth.

* SPANNING TREE

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree

A spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree
which includes all of the vertices of G, with minimum possible number of
edges. In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph
that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree.

Necessary Conditon For Spanning Tree :
1. There should no cycle in spanning tree (trees don't have cycles),
   but this doesn't mean that graph should not contain cycles.
2. Graph should be connected , if not connected we will get spanning
   trees for any one of the component of the  graph.

$$
NumberOfSpanningTree = C{{Edge}\choose{Vertex-1}} - NumberOfCycle
$$

** MINIMUM SPANNING TREE

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree

*** PRIM'S MINIMUM SPANNING TREE

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/
When applied on non connected graph it will provide spanning tree for any
one of the component of the graph.

$$
TimeComplexity = O(edges * (vertices-1))
			   = O(n^)
$$

*** KRUSKAL'S MIMIMUM SPANNING TREE

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algo-2/
When applied on non connected graph it will provide spanning tree for
any all of the component of the graph

$$
TimeComplexity = O(edges * (vertices-1))
			   = O(n^)
$$

But when we use min-heap to sort vertex then complextity reduces to nlogn .
Prim's algo focus on forming tree but kruskal's algo focus on finding
minimum spanning tree and hence well suited for this problem.
