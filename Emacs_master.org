#+TITLE: Emacs Master Notes

Emacs is a self documenting editor and writing documentation for it's keybinding is
dumb af.
* Info Mode
1. f, l - move forward and back in history respectively
2. m - list the menu for current node
3. d - Go to the Info directory node
4. L - Go to list of visited node
* Help Mode
1. C-h i d m KEYWORD - search for KEYWORD in emacs info manual
2. C-h k KEY - describe keybinding
3. C-h w COMMAND - lists the keys that are bound to COMMAND
4. C-h f FUNCTION - describe function
5. C-h a - search for command
6. l - move back in history
7. C-h P - describe package
8. C-h S - finds an entry for symbol of a programming language
* Edit
1. C-x z - repeat last command
2. C-x SPC - toggle rectangle mark mode
3. C-x r N - sets line number in rectangle
* Mark
1. C-<SPC> C-<SPC> - sets mark without activating it
2. C-x C-<SPC> - jumps to latest entry in global buffer
3. C-u C-<SPC> - jump to previous mark
4. C-x C-p - mark page
5. C-x h - mark whole buffer
6. C-u C-/ - undo change in mark
7. C-x (C-l or C-u) - change case in mark
* Register
1. C-x r n - number-to-register
   Calling number-to-register without an argument will just store the number 0 to the register you specify.
   Whereas C-u 100 C-x r n will store 100. In practice, you often want to use the latter method.
2. C-x r s - copy-to-register (think "save string")
3. C-x r r - copy-rectangle-to-register
4. C-x r S - C	point-to-register
5. C-x r w - window-configuration-to-register
6. C-x r f - frameset-to-register (frames and their windows)
7. C-x r + - increment-register (better used with numbers)
   Use increment-register to increment a number by one.
   Pass a numeric argument to increment by that amount instead.
   For example, to increment by five do C-u 5 C-x r + and then select the register you want to operate on.
   This only affects the value stored in the register. It does not also insert it in the buffer.
8. C-x r i - insert-register (text, number, rectangle)
9. C-x r j - jump-to-register (to point or window/frameset config)
* Windows
** Narrowing
1. C-x n n - Narrow down to between point and mark (‘narrow-to-region’).
2. C-x n w - Widen to make the entire buffer accessible again (‘widen’).
3. C-x n p - Narrow down to the current page (‘narrow-to-page’).
4. C-x n d - Narrow down to the current defun (‘narrow-to-defun’).
** whitespaces
1. show-trailing whitespace
   <F6> defined in init.el can be used to toggle display of white spaces
2. C-c z - delete Trailing whitespaces
* Search and replace
Numeric argument to search is possible!
1. M-% - run query replace
2. M-s o - run occur on regex
3. M-s . - search word on point
** Extend I-search
Following command assumes that you are in 'I-search' prompt.
1. C-h C-h - runs help
2. M-e - edit minibuffer of current search string
3. M-s C-e - Append rest of line to search string
4. C-r - Converts regular search into regex search
