#+TITLE: Emacs Master Notes

* Info Mode
** f, l - move forward and back in history respectively 
** m - list the menu for current node
** d - Go to the Info directory node
** L - Go to list of visited node
* Help Mode
** C-h i d m KEYWORD - search for KEYWORD in emacs info manual
** C-h k KEY - describe keybinding 
** C-h w COMMAND - lists the keys that are bound to COMMAND
** C-h f FUNCTION - describe function
** C-h a - search for command 
** l - move back in history
** C-h P - describe package
** C-h S - finds an entry for symbol of a programming language
* Edit
** C-x z - repeat last command
** C-x SPC - toggle rectangle mark mode
** C-x r N - sets line number in rectangle
* Mark
** C-<SPC> C-<SPC> - sets mark without activating it
** C-x C-<SPC> - jumps to latest entry in global buffer
** C-u C-<SPC> - jump to previous mark
** C-x C-p - mark page
** C-x h - mark whole buffer
** C-u C-/ - undo change in mark
** C-x (C-l or C-u) - change case in mark
* Register
** C-x r n - number-to-register
   Calling number-to-register without an argument will just store the number 0 to the register you specify. 
   Whereas C-u 100 C-x r n will store 100. In practice, you often want to use the latter method.
** C-x r s - copy-to-register (think "save string")
** C-x r r - copy-rectangle-to-register
** C-x r S - C	point-to-register
** C-x r w - window-configuration-to-register
** C-x r f - frameset-to-register (frames and their windows)
** C-x r + - increment-register (better used with numbers)
   Use increment-register to increment a number by one.
   Pass a numeric argument to increment by that amount instead.
   For example, to increment by five do C-u 5 C-x r + and then select the register you want to operate on.
   This only affects the value stored in the register. It does not also insert it in the buffer.
** C-x r i - insert-register (text, number, rectangle)
** C-x r j - jump-to-register (to point or window/frameset config)
* Windows
** C-M-l - reposition window heuristically 
   'reposition-window’ scrolls the current window heuristically in a way 
   designed to get useful information onto the screen.  
   For example, in a Lisp file, this command tries to get the 
   entire current defun onto the screen if possible.
** Narrowing
*** C-x n n - Narrow down to between point and mark (‘narrow-to-region’).
*** C-x n w - Widen to make the entire buffer accessible again (‘widen’).
*** C-x n p - Narrow down to the current page (‘narrow-to-page’).
*** C-x n d - Narrow down to the current defun (‘narrow-to-defun’).
