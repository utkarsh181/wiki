#+TITLE: Emacs master notes

Emacs is a self documenting editor and writing notes for it's keybinding is
dumb af.

* Info Mode

1. f, l - move forward and back in history respectively
2. m - list the menu for current node
3. d - Go to the Info directory node
4. L - Go to list of visited node

* Help Mode

1. C-h i d m KEYWORD - search for KEYWORD in emacs info manual
2. C-h k KEY - describe keybinding
3. C-h w COMMAND - lists the keys that are bound to COMMAND
4. C-h f FUNCTION - describe function
5. C-h a - search for command
6. l - move back in history
7. C-h P - describe package
8. C-h S - finds an entry for symbol of a programming language

* Edit

1. C-x z - repeat last command
2. C-x SPC - toggle rectangle mark mode
3. C-x r N - sets line number in rectangle
4. M-m - move to first non whitespace character in line
5. M-x subword-mode - treats CamelCase as distinct word
6. M-x superword-mode - treats snake_case as one word
7. C-x TAB - change the indentation of all lines that
   begin in the region

** s-expression

1. C-M-f - move forward by s-exp
2. C-M-b - move backward by ..
3. C-M-d - move down into a list
4. C-M-u - move up a list
5. C-M-k - kill a s-exp   

* Mark

1. C-<SPC> C-<SPC> - sets mark without activating it
2. C-x C-<SPC> - jumps to latest entry in global buffer
3. C-u C-<SPC> - jump to previous mark
4. C-x C-p - mark page
5. C-x h - mark whole buffer
6. C-u C-/ - undo change in mark
7. C-x (C-l or C-u) - change case in mark

* Case conversion

1. M-- M-l - convert last word to lower case
2. M-- M-u - convert last word to all uppercase
3. M-- M-c - convert last word initial to capital

* Register

1. C-x r n - number-to-register
   Calling number-to-register without an argument will just store the number 0 to the register you specify.
   Whereas =C-u 100 C-x r n= will store 100. In practice, you often want to use the latter method.
2. C-x r s - copy-to-register (think "save string")
3. C-x r r - copy-rectangle-to-register
4. C-x r S - C	point-to-register
5. C-x r w - window-configuration-to-register
6. C-x r f - frameset-to-register (frames and their windows)
7. C-x r + - increment-register (better used with numbers)
   Use increment-register to increment a number by one.
   Pass a numeric argument to increment by that amount instead.
   For example, to increment by five do C-u 5 C-x r + and then select the register you want to operate on.
   This only affects the value stored in the register. It does not also insert it in the buffer.
8. C-x r i - insert-register (text, number, rectangle)
9. C-x r j - jump-to-register (to point or window/frameset config)

* Windows

1. C-x } - make window wider
2. C-x { - make window narrower

** Narrowing

1. C-x n n - Narrow down to between point and mark (‘narrow-to-region’).
2. C-x n w - Widen to make the entire buffer accessible again (‘widen’).
3. C-x n p - Narrow down to the current page (‘narrow-to-page’).
4. C-x n d - Narrow down to the current defun (‘narrow-to-defun’).

** Whitespaces

1. show-trailing whitespace
   <F6> defined in init.el can be used to toggle display of white spaces
2. C-c z - delete Trailing whitespaces

* Replace

1. M-% - run query replace
2. M-s o - run occur on regex
3. M-s . - search word on point

* Macros

Finally!!

1. F3 & F4 - start and end definition of macro
2. F4 & C-x e - execute macro
3. C-u C-u F3 - append key to last macro without executing it
4. C-x C-k C-h - help for all command on macro ring

* Files

1. Variable default-directory stores working directory for the current buffer.
   It's value can be obtained by =M-x pwd= and altered using =M-x cd=.
2. To change visited buffer file name =M-x set-visited-file-name=.

** Image files

1. n and p - to move around images in same directory
2. m - mark image in the subsequent dired buffer
   
* Modes

Emacs chooses a major mode automatically. But to specify it using file-local
mode variable:

put the mode name in the first nonblank line, preceded and followed by ‘-*-’.
For ex:
     ; -*-Lisp-*-
     ; -*- mode: Lisp;-*-

To specify minor modes also:
     ; -*- mode: Lisp; eval: (auto-fill-mode 1); -*-
* Dired

1. C-x C-j - dired jump
2. C-c C-j - dired jump other window
3. C-u k - kill sub-directory listing
