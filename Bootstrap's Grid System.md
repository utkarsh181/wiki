# GRID SYSTEM
[Bootstrap Docs For Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
Bootstrap grid system uses flex-box grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers. It helps us to optimize our web pages for different screen sizes.
Tip: Remember that grid columns should add up to twelve for a row. More than that, columns will stack no matter the view-port.

# GRID OPTIONS
[Bootstrap Docs For Grid options](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#grid-options)
The Bootstrap grid system has five options:

1. .col- (for extra small devices that are 576px wide)
2. .col-sm- (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
3. .col-md- (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
4. .col-lg- (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
5. .col-xl- (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

As devices evolve their screen size changes and thus new-options are introduced in newer version of bootstrap.

# GRID SYSTEM RULES
Some Bootstrap grid system rules:

1. Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
2. Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
3. Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
4. Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
5. Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
6. Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
7. Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
